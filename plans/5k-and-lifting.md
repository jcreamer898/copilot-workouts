Let’s build a structured one-month plan that integrates your 5K runs, strength training, and recovery days. I'll break it down into a weekly rotation with a progressive increase in intensity. You'll cycle through different strength training focuses while balancing endurance, mobility, and recovery.

Month-long Strength & Running Plan

Week 1: Foundation Phase (Building a Base)

Monday: 5K run (steady pace) + Core workout (planks, leg raises, Russian twists)

Tuesday: Upper body push workout (bench press, shoulder press, push-ups)

Wednesday: Lower body strength (squats, lunges, Romanian deadlifts)

Thursday: Active recovery (mobility work, yoga, light cardio)

Friday: Upper body pull workout (pull-ups, rows, curls)

Saturday: Optional HIIT cardio + full-body strength (deadlifts, thrusters, kettlebell swings)

Sunday: Rest or light mobility work

Week 2: Strength & Endurance Boost

Monday: 5K run (interval training: sprint 30s, jog 1 min) + core workout

Tuesday: Upper body push (increase weight, focus on form)

Wednesday: Lower body (add plyometric exercises like jump squats)

Thursday: Active recovery or mobility work

Friday: Pull day with extra grip work (farmer’s carries, dead hangs)

Saturday: Cardio (hill sprints) + full-body functional training

Sunday: Rest or light stretching

Week 3: Progressive Overload (Increasing Strength)

Monday: 5K run (steady pace) + core workout

Tuesday: Heavy upper-body push day (low reps, high weight)

Wednesday: Lower-body strength (focus on hip thrusts, Bulgarian split squats)

Thursday: Active recovery (foam rolling, light movement)

Friday: Heavy pull workout (deadlifts, weighted pull-ups)

Saturday: HIIT + mobility drills

Sunday: Rest

Week 4: Power & Speed Development

Monday: 5K run (fast finish: last mile at race pace) + core workout

Tuesday: Upper body push (explosive movements: push press, clapping push-ups)

Wednesday: Lower body + power movements (box jumps, sled pushes)

Thursday: Mobility day

Friday: Pull strength + grip endurance

Saturday: Full-body circuit (combining strength & cardio)

Sunday: Rest

Each week progressively builds on the last, ensuring that you're pushing yourself while preventing burnout. You can adjust weights, reps, and intensity depending on how your body feels. Let me know if you'd like to tweak anything further!
