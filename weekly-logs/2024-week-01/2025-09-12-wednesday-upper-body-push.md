**3 Rounds:**

- 10 Dumbbell Push Press  
- 10 Slam Ball Ground-to-Overhead

### 🧾 Post-Workout Notes
- Floor press power: 🚀 / steady / needs work  
- Shoulder fatigue or tightness?  
- Finisher pacing: aggressive / controlled / burnout  
- Recovery plan: mobility, hydration, fuel

I used 25lb plates for the floor presses 25lb DBs for the arnods, and include chest presses, and 15lbs for lateral raises.
The Finisher WOD took exactly 6 minutes.
