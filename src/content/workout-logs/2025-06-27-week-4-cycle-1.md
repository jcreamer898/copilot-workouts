Absolutely, Jonathan — let’s make your Friday pull day a beast of a session. We’ll start with a mobility-focused warmup, transition into heavy compound pulling for strength, and then finish with a WOD that keeps your heart pumping while hammering your back and arms.

### **Friday Week 3: Heavy Pull Day**

#### **1. Warm-up (10–12 mins)**
*Activate your posterior chain and prepare your pulling muscles:*

- Jump rope or rower – 3 minutes  
- Banded pull-aparts – 2 x 15  
- Inchworm walkouts + shoulder taps – 2 x 6  
- Dead hang from pull-up bar – 30 sec  
- Scapular pull-ups – 2 x 8  
- Light KB swings – 2 x 15

#### **2. Strength Focus: Heavy Compound Pulls**
*Take solid rest (2–3 min) between sets for max output.*

- **Conventional Deadlift** – 4 sets of 5 reps @ ~85% 1RM  
- **Weighted Pull-ups or Chin-ups** – 4 sets of 6–8 reps (use a belt or dumbbell between legs)  
- **Barbell Bent-over Row** – 3 sets of 8 reps (strict form, no momentum)  
- **Barbell Shrugs (with straps if needed)** – 3 sets of 12 (hold at the top)  

Optional: Add **farmer’s carries** (2 x 40 yards heavy) between sets to fry your grip.

#### **3. WOD: “Climb & Burn” (For Time or 4 Rounds)**
*Full-body cardio-pull combo with plenty of intensity.*

**4 Rounds:**
- 250m row (or 60-second Assault Bike)  
- 10 Renegade Rows (with push-up)  
- 15 Kettlebell Swings (heavy)  
- 10 Jumping Pull-ups or Chest-to-Bar Pull-ups  
- 20 Russian Twists (weighted)

**Score:** total time or cap at 18 minutes.

Would you like a version of this workout you can print or plug into a tracking sheet? Or a finisher to really burn out the arms?

No problem at all—let’s swap that rower out for something that still primes your pulling muscles and gets your heart rate up.

### **WOD Alternative: “Climb & Burn” (Modified)**
**4 Rounds:**
- **60 seconds high knees or jump rope** (cardio burst)  
- **10 Renegade Rows (with push-up)**  
- **15 Kettlebell or Dumbbell Swings**  
- **10 Jumping Pull-ups or Chest-to-Bar Pull-ups**  
- **20 Russian Twists (weighted)**

If you’ve got stairs or a hill nearby, running a flight or incline at the start of each round is a spicy alternative to simulate a strong pull-heavy cardio movement.
