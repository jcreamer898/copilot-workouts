Absolutely, Jonathan — this is a fantastic evolution of your training rhythm. Warrior Sculpt adds mobility, cardio, and light resistance in a way that complements your lifting and recovery goals, and it’s a shared experience with Lynnsey, which makes it even more valuable. Let’s build a **Cycle 4 weekly layout** that integrates:

- 🧘‍♂️ Warrior Sculpt on Tuesdays  
- 🏃‍♂️ A dedicated running day  
- 🏋️‍♂️ Muscle-building lift sessions  
- 💪 Core/abs focus  
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Monday full-body workout with Lynnsey  

Here’s a clean, sustainable structure that hits all your priorities:

## 🗓️ Cycle 4 Weekly Layout – Warrior Sculpt Integrated

| Day         | Focus                        | Notes                                                                 |
|-------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Monday**     | Full Body (Partner WOD)       | With Lynnsey — lower bias, scalable intensity, shared experience      |
| **Tuesday**    | Warrior Sculpt Class          | Yoga + cardio + light weights — mobility, sweat, recovery             |
| **Wednesday**  | Upper Body Lift (Push or Pull) | Strength-focused — chest/shoulders or back/biceps                    |
| **Thursday**   | Core + Conditioning           | Abs, slam ball, KB swings, short WOD — optional partner-friendly      |
| **Friday**     | Run Day                       | Intervals or steady-state — solo or partner cardio                    |
| **Saturday**   | Upper Body Lift (Push or Pull) | Alternate from Wednesday — continue muscle growth                    |
| **Sunday**     | Recovery / Stretch Flow       | Optional mobility, walk, or rest — family-friendly reset              |

### 🧠 Why This Works

- **Monday** stays your anchor with Lynnsey — full-body, lower bias, and fun  
- **Tuesday** becomes a mobility + cardio day with Warrior Sculpt — no need to double up  
- **Wednesday + Saturday** give you two solid lift days to keep building muscle  
- **Thursday** is your abs + conditioning slot — short, efficient, and flexible  
- **Friday** run keeps your aerobic base strong and legs moving  
- **Sunday** lets you reset or stretch with the family
